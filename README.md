# WebOS-GCnotes-for-LG-TV

GCnotas is a lightweight note editor built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The interface and all features are in Portuguese, and the app is designed mainly for use on web browsers and older webOS 4.5 TVs.

This project currently saves notes only locally using localStorage.
Nothing is synced online, and no cloud storage is supported yet.

Some features are still incomplete or experimental, and certain buttons may not work as intended depending on the device or browser.
